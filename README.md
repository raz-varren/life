# Conway's Game of Life

I got bored one day and decided to make this for no good reason at all.

Pretty much everything you need to know about how to use this is in this [example](https://github.com/raz-varren/life/blob/master/examples/300-to-dead.go).

I might add mutations in the future if I get bored again. Otherwise, I guess enjoy this completely useless Go program.
